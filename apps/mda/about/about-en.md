### MDA: My diary

A diary where you can record all the events of your life.  

We live in a world where we are losing the habit of writing. Most people only write what is necessary, such as emails, text messages, meeting notes, or reminders. Nowadays, few have the habit of putting their feelings and reflections on paper.  

However, journaling can be a transformative habit. Countless studies point out that writing about our daily lives, ideas, emotions and goals has a very positive effect on our physical and mental health.  

<b>"Writing in a diary increases self-esteem and motivation, and promotes self-confidence."</b>
