### MTL: My timeline

Ever wondered the last time you did something or when something happened? Do you remember but couldn't?

Sometimes all you need is a simple, visual way to see your progress and how much you've accomplished.

My Timeline (MTL) is a timeline where you can organize all your events according to each category or project!

#### Past events

MTL helps you to keep track of all your events and progress. Record your day-to-day events and never forget them when they pass.

#### Future events

You can add events with future data and the app will remind you through notifications when this event arrives.

#### Multiple timelines

You can separate timeline events into projects or categories, creating a special timeline for each subject.

#### Freemium/PRO

MTL is a free app, but you also have the option to unlock even more features by activating the PRO package.

★  Create as many projects as you want
★  Backup and restore your projects
★  Use dark mode

We are constantly evolving the app! Many more features will be added in the future.
