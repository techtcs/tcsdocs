#### Outliers: 10k Hours counter

10,000 hours, that's the amount of hours that the author of "Outliers", Malcolm Gladwell says is the dedication it takes to become an expert in whatever you want!

#### Talent and Preparation

It is well known that the success we achieve in any activity derives from 2 aspects: one is talent, what is born with us, our predestination. The second aspect, however, is preparation, study, training, experience.

New research increasingly points out that, surprisingly, between these two aspects, preparation is more important than talent. You've probably heard that phrase that says success comes from 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration, right?

Ten thousand hours of practice. This is therefore equivalent to 3 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, for 10 years. In this way, it is said that for you to truly stand out at something, it takes 10 years of dedication, training and repetition. This is called the ten thousand hour rule.
